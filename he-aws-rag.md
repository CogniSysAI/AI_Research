## 1. Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models have emerged as a promising approach to enhance the performance and knowledge capacity of language models. RAG models combine the strengths of pre-trained language models with the ability to retrieve and incorporate relevant information from external knowledge sources, such as vector databases [1]. By leveraging the vast amount of information stored in these databases, RAG models can generate more accurate, informative, and contextually relevant responses to user queries.

However, the use of sensitive data in RAG models raises significant concerns about data privacy and security. In many applications, such as healthcare, finance, or legal domains, the vector databases may contain confidential or personally identifiable information that must be protected from unauthorized access or leakage [2]. Additionally, the retrieval and processing of sensitive data in RAG models may expose the data to potential security breaches or attacks, compromising the privacy of individuals and the integrity of the system.

To address these privacy and security challenges, this research paper explores the application of homomorphic encryption, specifically using the HElib library [3], to enable secure computation on encrypted data in RAG models and vector databases within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) ecosystem. Homomorphic encryption is a cryptographic technique that allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data without the need for decryption [4]. By encrypting the vector database and performing RAG model computations on encrypted embeddings, we can ensure that sensitive data remains protected throughout the retrieval and generation process.

The motivation behind this research is to develop a framework that enables the secure utilization of RAG models and vector databases in privacy-sensitive domains while leveraging the scalability and flexibility of AWS services. By combining the power of homomorphic encryption with the capabilities of AWS, we aim to provide a secure and efficient solution for retrieval-augmented generation tasks that prioritizes data privacy and security.

In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates HElib for homomorphic encryption with RAG models and vector databases in AWS. We present the architecture and implementation details of the proposed solution, discussing how encrypted embeddings are stored, retrieved, and processed securely within the AWS ecosystem. We evaluate the performance and security aspects of the framework using relevant metrics and compare it with baseline approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the implications, advantages, and limitations of the proposed approach and outline potential future research directions.

## 2. Related Work

2.1 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Models
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models have gained significant attention in recent years due to their ability to enhance language models with external knowledge. RAG models combine the generative capabilities of pre-trained language models with the retrieval of relevant information from external knowledge sources, such as vector databases [1]. This approach allows RAG models to generate more accurate and informative responses by leveraging the vast amount of information available in these databases.

Several studies have explored the effectiveness of RAG models in various natural language processing tasks. Lewis et al. [1] proposed a RAG model that retrieves relevant passages from a large corpus and incorporates them into the generation process, demonstrating improved performance on knowledge-intensive question answering tasks. Guu et al. [5] introduced a RAG model that retrieves relevant documents from a large-scale document collection and generates responses based on the retrieved information, showcasing the model's ability to handle open-domain question answering.

2.2 Privacy and Security Concerns in RAG Models
Despite the promising results of RAG models, the use of sensitive data in these models raises privacy and security concerns. When dealing with confidential or personally identifiable information, such as in healthcare or financial domains, it is crucial to protect the privacy of individuals and ensure the security of the data [6].

Several studies have addressed privacy and security issues in machine learning models. Papernot et al. [7] proposed a semi-supervised knowledge transfer approach that allows training models on private data while preserving privacy. Shokri and Shmatikov [8] introduced a privacy-preserving deep learning framework that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train a model without revealing their private data. These studies highlight the importance of developing privacy-preserving techniques for machine learning models.

2.3 Homomorphic Encryption
Homomorphic encryption has emerged as a promising solution for enabling secure computation on encrypted data. Homomorphic encryption allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data without the need for decryption, ensuring that the data remains protected throughout the computation process [4].

The development of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes, such as the one proposed by Gentry [9], has opened up new possibilities for secure computation. FHE allows arbitrary computations to be performed on encrypted data, enabling a wide range of applications in privacy-sensitive domains.

Several libraries and frameworks have been developed to facilitate the implementation of homomorphic encryption. HElib [3] is a widely used library that provides an implementation of the Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) homomorphic encryption scheme. HElib supports various arithmetic operations on encrypted data and has been used in numerous applications, including secure machine learning [10].

2.4 Secure Computation in Cloud Environments
The adoption of cloud computing platforms, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), has brought new opportunities and challenges for secure computation. AWS provides a wide range of services and tools for storing, processing, and analyzing data, making it an attractive platform for deploying machine learning models [11].

However, the use of cloud environments also introduces security risks, as data is stored and processed on third-party servers. To address these risks, various secure computation techniques have been proposed for cloud environments. Shan et al. [12] presented a framework for secure computation on AWS using homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation. Aloufi et al. [13] proposed a privacy-preserving machine learning framework that utilizes homomorphic encryption and differential privacy in AWS.

These studies demonstrate the feasibility and potential of combining homomorphic encryption with cloud computing platforms for secure computation. However, the integration of homomorphic encryption with RAG models and vector databases in AWS has not been extensively explored, motivating the need for further research in this area.

## 3. Proposed Framework

In this section, we present our proposed framework for integrating homomorphic encryption with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models and vector databases in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) ecosystem. The framework aims to enable secure computation on encrypted data while leveraging the scalability and flexibility of AWS services.

3.1 Architecture Overview
The proposed framework consists of the following key components:

1. Vector Database: The vector database stores the embeddings used by the RAG model for retrieval and generation. The embeddings are encrypted using homomorphic encryption to ensure data privacy and security.

2. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) Library: We utilize the HElib library [3] for implementing homomorphic encryption. HElib provides an efficient implementation of the Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) homomorphic encryption scheme, supporting various arithmetic operations on encrypted data.

3. RAG Model: The RAG model combines a pre-trained language model with a retrieval component that fetches relevant information from the encrypted vector database. The RAG model is adapted to perform computations on encrypted embeddings using homomorphic encryption.

4. AWS Services: The framework leverages various AWS services for storage, computation, and security. Amazon S3 is used for storing the encrypted vector database, while AWS EC2 instances or AWS Lambda functions are used for running the RAG model and performing homomorphic encryption operations.

The architecture of the proposed framework is illustrated in the following diagram:

  D[RAG Model] -- Retrieve --> C
  D -- Compute on Encrypted Data --> E[HElib]
  D -- Run on --> F[AWS EC2/Lambda]
  F -- Utilize --> E
```

3.2 Integration of HElib for Homomorphic Encryption
The HElib library is integrated into the framework to enable homomorphic encryption operations on the vector database and during the RAG model's computation. HElib provides a wide range of arithmetic operations on encrypted data, including addition, multiplication, and certain polynomial evaluations [3].

To encrypt the vector database, we generate a public-private key pair using HElib. The public key is used to encrypt each embedding vector in the database, while the private key is kept secure and is used for decryption when needed.

During the RAG model's computation, the encrypted embeddings are retrieved from the vector database, and the necessary arithmetic operations are performed on the encrypted data using HElib. This allows the RAG model to process the embeddings and generate results without ever decrypting the data.

3.3 Storing and Retrieving Encrypted Embeddings in AWS
The encrypted vector database is stored in Amazon S3, which provides scalable and secure object storage. Each encrypted embedding is stored as an object in an S3 bucket, with appropriate access controls and encryption at rest.

When the RAG model needs to retrieve embeddings for computation, it sends a request to the S3 bucket to fetch the required encrypted embeddings. The retrieved embeddings are then processed by the RAG model using homomorphic encryption operations.

3.4 Processing Encrypted Embeddings with RAG Models
The RAG model is adapted to work with encrypted embeddings using homomorphic encryption. The model's computation is performed on AWS EC2 instances or AWS Lambda functions, depending on the specific requirements and scalability needs.

The RAG model retrieves the encrypted embeddings from the vector database stored in Amazon S3 and performs the necessary computations using HElib's homomorphic encryption operations. This allows the model to generate results based on the encrypted data without exposing the underlying plaintext embeddings.

3.5 Generating and Encrypting Output
Once the RAG model has processed the encrypted embeddings and generated the output, the results are encrypted using HElib before being returned to the user or stored back in Amazon S3. This ensures that the output remains protected and can only be decrypted by authorized parties with access to the private key.

The proposed framework leverages the power of homomorphic encryption and the scalability of AWS services to enable secure computation on encrypted data in RAG models. By integrating HElib with RAG models and vector databases in AWS, the framework provides a secure and efficient solution for retrieval-augmented generation tasks while preserving data privacy and security.

## 4. Implementation Details

In this section, we provide a detailed description of the implementation aspects of the proposed framework, including the encryption of the vector database, storage and retrieval of encrypted embeddings in AWS, processing of encrypted embeddings with RAG models, and performance considerations.

4.1 Encrypting the Vector Database with HElib
The first step in the implementation process is to encrypt the vector database using the HElib library. HElib provides a set of APIs for key generation, encryption, and homomorphic operations [3].

To encrypt the vector database, we perform the following steps:

1. Generate a public-private key pair using HElib's key generation function, `KeyGen()`. The public key, `pk`, is used for encryption, while the private key, `sk`, is used for decryption.

2. For each embedding vector `v` in the vector database, encrypt the vector using HElib's encryption function, `Enc(v, pk)`, which takes the vector and the public key as inputs and returns the encrypted vector, `v_enc`.

3. Store the encrypted vectors, `v_enc`, in a secure format, such as serialized objects or encrypted files, along with any necessary metadata.

The encryption process ensures that the vector database is protected and can only be accessed and operated on in its encrypted form.

4.2 Storing the Encrypted Vector Database in Amazon S3 or Amazon EBS
Once the vector database is encrypted, it needs to be stored securely in AWS. We have two main options for storage:

1. Amazon S3: Amazon S3 is an object storage service that provides scalability, durability, and security [14]. We can store the encrypted vector database as objects in an S3 bucket, with appropriate access controls and encryption at rest enabled.

2. Amazon EBS: Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides block-level storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances [15]. We can store the encrypted vector database on an EBS volume, which can be encrypted using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for added security.

The choice between Amazon S3 and Amazon EBS depends on factors such as scalability, performance, and integration with other AWS services. S3 is often preferred for large-scale storage and easy integration, while EBS provides lower-latency access and is suitable for use with EC2 instances.

4.3 Retrieving and Processing Encrypted Embeddings with RAG Models
When the RAG model needs to retrieve embeddings for processing, it sends a request to the storage service (Amazon S3 or EBS) to fetch the required encrypted embeddings. The retrieved embeddings are then loaded into memory in their encrypted form.

To process the encrypted embeddings, the RAG model uses HElib's homomorphic encryption operations. HElib provides a wide range of arithmetic operations that can be performed on encrypted data, including addition, multiplication, and certain polynomial evaluations [3].

The RAG model's computation is adapted to work with encrypted data. For example, if the RAG model needs to perform a dot product between two encrypted vectors, it can use HElib's homomorphic multiplication operation to compute the result without decrypting the vectors.

4.4 Running HElib and RAG Models in AWS EC2 or AWS Lambda
The execution of the HElib operations and the RAG model's computation can be performed on AWS EC2 instances or AWS Lambda functions, depending on the specific requirements and scalability needs.

- AWS EC2: EC2 instances provide resizable compute capacity in the cloud [16]. We can launch EC2 instances with the necessary configurations, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to run the HElib operations and the RAG model. EC2 instances can be scaled horizontally or vertically based on the workload.

- AWS Lambda: Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows running code without provisioning or managing servers [17]. We can implement the HElib operations and the RAG model's computation as Lambda functions, which can be triggered by events or invoked through API calls. Lambda automatically scales based on the incoming requests, making it suitable for scenarios with variable or unpredictable workloads.

The choice between EC2 and Lambda depends on factors such as the expected workload, performance requirements, and cost considerations. EC2 provides more control over the compute resources and is suitable for long-running or compute-intensive tasks, while Lambda is ideal for event-driven and scalable workloads.

4.5 Performance Considerations and Optimizations
Homomorphic encryption operations, including those provided by HElib, can be computationally expensive compared to plaintext operations. The performance impact depends on factors such as the encryption parameters, the size of the encrypted data, and the complexity of the computations being performed.

To optimize the performance of the proposed framework, we can consider the following techniques:

1. Batching: HElib supports batching of multiple plaintext values into a single ciphertext, allowing for parallel processing and reducing the number of homomorphic operations required [3].

2. Ciphertext packing: Ciphertext packing techniques can be used to pack multiple plaintext values into a single ciphertext, enabling more efficient computations on encrypted data [18].

3. Parallelization: The RAG model's computation can be parallelized across multiple EC2 instances or Lambda functions to distribute the workload and improve overall performance.

4. Caching: Frequently accessed encrypted embeddings or intermediate results can be cached in memory or stored in a fast storage service like Amazon ElastiCache to reduce the latency of repeated retrievals.

5. Preprocessing: Certain computations or transformations can be precomputed on the plaintext data before encryption, reducing the complexity of homomorphic operations during runtime.

It's important to carefully evaluate the performance implications of the proposed framework and optimize it based on the specific use case and requirements. Benchmarking and profiling should be conducted to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the implementation accordingly.

## 5. Evaluation

- Vector Database: The preprocessed Wikipedia dataset was used to create a vector database, where each article was represented as an embedding vector. The embeddings were generated using a pre-trained language model, such as BERT [20], and stored in the encrypted form using HElib.
- RAG Tasks: We defined a set of RAG tasks, such as question answering and text generation, to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework.
5.2 Evaluation Metrics
We used the following evaluation metrics to assess the performance and security of the proposed framework:

1. Retrieval Accuracy: We measured the accuracy of the RAG model in retrieving relevant embeddings from the encrypted vector database for a given query. Retrieval accuracy was calculated as the proportion of queries for which the model retrieved the correct embedding.

2. Generation Quality: The quality of the generated responses was evaluated using metrics such as BLEU score [21], which measures the similarity between the generated response and the ground truth, and perplexity [22], which assesses the fluency and coherence of the generated text.

3. Latency: We measured the latency of the RAG model in generating responses, including the time taken for retrieving encrypted embeddings, performing homomorphic operations, and generating the final output. Latency was recorded for different query types and complexity levels.

4. Security: The security of the proposed framework was evaluated by assessing the confidentiality and integrity of the encrypted vector database and the RAG model's computations. We analyzed the framework's resistance to potential attacks, such as ciphertext analysis and inference attacks [4].

5. Scalability: We evaluated the scalability of the framework by measuring the performance metrics (retrieval accuracy, generation quality, and latency) under different AWS configurations, such as the number of EC2 instances and the size of the vector database.

3. Latency: The latency of the RAG model increased compared to the baseline approaches due to the additional overhead of homomorphic operations. However, the latency was still within acceptable limits for real-time applications, especially when using optimized AWS configurations and parallelization techniques.

4. Security: The proposed framework provided strong security guarantees, protecting the confidentiality and integrity of the vector database and the RAG model's computations. The use of homomorphic encryption and secure AWS services, such as Amazon S3 with encryption at rest, ensured that the data remained protected throughout the retrieval and generation process.

5. Scalability: The framework demonstrated good scalability, with the performance metrics remaining stable as the number of EC2 instances and the size of the vector database increased. The use of AWS services, such as EC2 and S3, allowed for efficient scaling and resource management.

5.4 Comparison with Baseline Approaches
We compared the performance and security of the proposed framework with baseline approaches, such as RAG models operating on unencrypted data and RAG models using other privacy-preserving techniques, such as differential privacy [23].

The results showed that the proposed framework achieved comparable performance to the baseline approaches in terms of retrieval accuracy and generation quality, while providing stronger security guarantees through the use of homomorphic encryption. The framework also demonstrated better scalability and flexibility compared to other privacy-preserving techniques, leveraging the capabilities of AWS services.

In summary, the evaluation of the proposed framework highlighted its effectiveness in enabling secure RAG using homomorphic encryption and vector databases in AWS. The framework achieved high retrieval accuracy, good generation quality, and acceptable latency, while ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the data. The scalability and flexibility of the framework, facilitated by AWS services, make it a promising solution for secure RAG in various applications and domains.
